# EchoMesh: Decentralized Bandwidth Marketplace

EchoMesh is a high-performance, decentralized bandwidth-sharing protocol built for the modern, privacy-conscious web. It allows anyone to contribute their idle internet capacity to a global mesh network, earning real-time rewards while providing secure, low-latency connectivity for decentralized applications.

## 🌟 The Vision
To create a borderless, community-owned internet infrastructure where access is a liquid asset and every participant is fairly compensated.

## 🚀 Key Advantages
- **Decentralized Economy**: Built on Solana for near-instant payout settlement.
- **Privacy First**: Secure, encrypted tunnels with privacy-minimized logging.
- **Enterprise QoS**: High-throughput architecture with <250ms p95 latency targets.
- **Transparent Rewards**: Automated reputation scoring and performance-based earnings.

## 🛠 Features
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: High-density telemetry showing live network health.
- **Smart Payouts**: Automated settlement logic with built-in quality-of-service penalties.
- **Resilient Infrastructure**: Auto-recovery and backoff mechanisms for continuous uptime.
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Pro-grade UI designed for dedicated node operators.

## 📈 Roadmap
1.  **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Secure client dashboard and telemetry system. (Completed)
2.  **Phase 2**: Integration with Solana Devnet for Echo Token rewards. (In-Progress)
3.  **Phase 3**: Global coordinator expansion and regional hub deployment.
4.  **Phase 4**: Full protocol decentralization and DAO governance.
