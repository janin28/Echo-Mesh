# EchoMesh: Decentralized Bandwidth Economy

EchoMesh is a revolutionary decentralized bandwidth-sharing protocol that transforms dormant internet capacity into a liquid, high-performance network asset. By bridging local connectivity with a secure, blockchain-verified economy, EchoMesh empowers users to monetize their idle resources while providing a robust backbone for the next generation of privacy-centric web services.
